To ensure safe and sustainable development during this time of rapid growth for the City of Austin, the permitting process facilitates and regulates building projects. 

**The Permitting Initiative** will rethink the informational and operational structures that govern permitting to develop an experience that is accessible, tangible, and cohesive for the public and city staff.

The Permitting Initiative is developed by the City of Austinâ€™s [Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellows](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/) in collaboration with the Development Services Department.
